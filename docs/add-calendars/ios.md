# Subscribe to Online Calendars on iOS Devices

iOS devices, such as iPhones and iPads, come with a built-in calendar app that allows you to manage your schedule and events. In addition to managing your own personal calendar, you can also subscribe to online calendars that are shared by others. This can be useful if you want to keep track of events or appointments that are relevant to you, but are not part of your personal calendar.

Here is how to subscribe to online calendars on your iOS device:

1. Open the Calendar app on your iOS device.
2. Tap the `Calendars` button in the center bottom of the screen.
3. Tap the `Add Account` button.
4. Tap the `Add Subscribed Calendar` option.
5. Enter the URL of the online calendar that you want to subscribe to.
6. Tap the `Next` button.
7. Enter a description for the calendar (optional).
8. Tap the `Save` button.

The online calendar should now be added to your list of calendars in the Calendar app. You can toggle the visibility of the calendar by tapping the calendar's name in the list of calendars.
